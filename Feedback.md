## Feedback
<p>I prefer to receive feedback: face to face in person</p>
<p>If you are going to correct me: (just tell me what I did wrong don't sugar coat it)</p>
<p>If you are going to tell me I'm doing something wrong, phrase it this way:just tell me what i have done wrong </p>
<p>If you want to praise me:not in class just while I'm by myself</p>
<p>It is important to me that feedback is:not to late after i have made a mistake.</p>
